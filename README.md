# Heart-Attack-Prediction-Model
## Introduction
Welcome to the Heart Attack Prediction repository! Here, you'll find an innovative model designed to predict the risk of heart attacks based on basic health parameters. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and a user-friendly Flask web application, this project aims to provide valuable insights into cardiovascular health.

## About the Dataset
Our model's predictive prowess is fueled by a comprehensive dataset comprising health records from over 10,000 patients. Sourced from Kaggle, this rich repository of data ensures the robustness and reliability of our predictive analytics.
# Model Building Phase:-

## Model Overview
Let's dive into the heart of the matter! Our prediction model employs the powerful XGBoost algorithm, renowned for its accuracy and versatility in handling complex data patterns. By analyzing key health metrics, such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, the model delivers reliable predictions regarding potential heart attack risks.

## Model Training
Training the model involves harnessing the wealth of information within the dataset to fine-tune our predictive algorithms. Through rigorous experimentation and optimization, our model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of approximately 70% on unseen data.
## Model Evaluation 
To gauge the model's performance, we employ standard evaluation metrics, validating its accuracy and efficacy in real-world scenarios. With a success rate of around 70%, our model proves its mettle in predicting heart attack risks.
